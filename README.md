Auto-VMAF Encoder
An advanced Python script for video encoding that uses a data-driven approach to determine optimal encoding parameters. The script finds the perfect CQ/CRF (Constant Quality Factor / Constant Rate Factor) value to achieve a target video quality, as measured by a predefined VMAF (Video Multimethod Assessment Fusion) score.

Real-time encoding progress with multi-threaded workers and performance statistics
üéØ Key Features
Smart Encoding

Intelligent Sampling: Analyzes short video samples using multiple detection methods (PySceneDetect, keyframe analysis, or time intervals) to find key scenes and assess media complexity
VMAF-Targeted Quality: Uses binary search to find the optimal CQ/CRF value that achieves your target VMAF score with mathematical precision
Complexity-Aware Processing: Automatically adjusts encoding parameters based on video complexity analysis

Multi-Encoder Support

NVENC AV1: Hardware-accelerated encoding with configurable presets and quality modes
SVT-AV1: Software encoding with customizable presets and film grain settings
Color Space Preservation: Maintains HDR, color primaries, and transfer characteristics from source

Advanced Caching System

VMAF Cache: Stores VMAF comparison results to avoid re-testing identical samples
Performance Database: Learns from past encodes to provide accurate ETA predictions
Complexity-Aware Caching: Cache keys include video complexity scores for better accuracy

Real-Time Performance Monitoring

Live Progress UI: Beautiful console interface with real-time progress bars and statistics
Multi-Threading: Parallel processing of multiple files with configurable worker limits
Memory Management: Intelligent memory monitoring to prevent system crashes
Detailed Logging: Comprehensive encoding logs with performance metrics

Intelligent File Management

Configurable Filtering: Skip files based on duration, file size, or bitrate thresholds
Size Reduction Validation: Only keeps encoded files that achieve meaningful size reduction
Flexible Output Options: Configurable output directories and file naming schemes
Safe Processing: Optional source file deletion with comprehensive validation

Precision ETA Calculation

Machine Learning-Based Predictions: Uses historical performance data to predict encoding times
Complexity-Adjusted Estimates: Factors in video complexity for more accurate time predictions
Real-Time Updates: Dynamic ETA adjustment based on current performance ratios
Component-Based Analysis: Separate time tracking for sampling, VMAF testing, and final encoding

Complete encoding workflow from file detection to optimized output
üöÄ Getting Started
Prerequisites

Python 3.8+ with pip
FFmpeg with VMAF support
Required Python packages:
bashpip install rich psutil

Optional for advanced scene detection (recommended):
bashpip install scenedetect\[opencv]



Installation

Download the script:

Download auto\_vmaf\_encoder.py from the releases
Or clone this repository



Install dependencies:
bashpip install -r requirements.txt

Configure the script:

Copy config.ini.example to config.ini
Edit the paths and settings according to your system
Required: Set paths to FFmpeg, FFprobe, and VMAF model



Run the encoder:
bashpython auto\_vmaf\_encoder.py



‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Example configuration with recommended settings
The script uses a comprehensive config.ini file for all settings:
Essential Settings
ini\[Paths]
ffmpeg\_path = /path/to/ffmpeg
ffprobe\_path = /path/to/ffprobe
vmaf\_model\_path = /path/to/vmaf\_v0.6.1.json

\[VMAF\_Targeting]
target\_vmaf = 95.0
vmaf\_tolerance = 1.0
cq\_search\_min = 15
cq\_search\_max = 35
Advanced Options

Encoder Selection: Choose between NVENC and SVT-AV1
Sampling Methods: Tier0 (scene detection), Tier1 (keyframes), or Tier2 (intervals)
Performance Tuning: Worker counts, memory limits, parallel VMAF runs
File Filtering: Duration, size, and bitrate thresholds
Output Control: Bit depth, color space handling, file management

üìä How It Works

File Discovery: Scans for video files while respecting filtering criteria
Complexity Analysis: Uses intelligent sampling to assess video complexity
Sample Creation: Extracts representative segments for VMAF testing
Binary Search: Iteratively tests CQ/CRF values to find the optimal setting
Final Encoding: Applies the discovered settings to encode the full video
Validation: Ensures meaningful size reduction before keeping the result

üéõÔ∏è Advanced Features
Tiered Sampling System

Tier 0: PySceneDetect for precise scene change detection
Tier 1: FFmpeg keyframe analysis for structural sampling
Tier 2: Time-based intervals as a reliable fallback

Performance Optimization

In-Memory Processing: VMAF comparisons using temporary files for speed
Parallel VMAF Testing: Multiple simultaneous quality tests
Intelligent Caching: Avoids redundant calculations across runs

Quality Assurance

Size Reduction Validation: Configurable minimum space savings threshold
Bitrate-Based Filtering: Skip files that are already efficiently encoded
Color Space Preservation: Maintains HDR and wide color gamut properties

üìà Performance

Example: 332MB video reduced to 181MB (45.6% savings) while maintaining VMAF 97.2
Typical performance improvements with caching enabled:

50-80% faster repeat processing of similar content
Accurate ETA predictions within 10-15% of actual time
Memory-efficient processing of large video files
Scalable from single-file to batch processing
