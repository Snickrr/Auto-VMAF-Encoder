This script automates the complex process of video encoding by intelligently analyzing video files, finding the optimal quality settings to meet a target VMAF score, and providing a real-time console UI to monitor the progress.

## üéØ Key Features

* **üß† Smart Encoding**
    * **Intelligent Sampling:** Analyzes video samples using multiple methods (PySceneDetect, keyframes, intervals) to assess media complexity.
    * **VMAF-Targeted Quality:** Uses a binary search algorithm to find the optimal CQ/CRF value that achieves your target VMAF score with precision.
    * **Complexity-Aware Processing:** Automatically adjusts parameters based on video complexity analysis.

* **‚öôÔ∏è Multi-Encoder Support**
    * **NVENC AV1:** Hardware-accelerated encoding with configurable presets.
    * **SVT-AV1:** High-quality software encoding with customizable presets and film grain settings.
    * **Color Space Preservation:** Maintains HDR, color primaries, and transfer characteristics from the source.

* **üöÄ Advanced Caching System**
    * **VMAF Cache:** Avoids re-testing identical video samples, dramatically speeding up re-runs.
    * **Performance Database:** Learns from past encodes to provide increasingly accurate ETA predictions.

* **üíª Real-Time Performance Monitoring**
    * **Live Progress UI:** A beautiful and functional console interface built with `rich`.
    * **Multi-Threading:** Process multiple files in parallel with configurable worker limits.
    * **Memory Management:** Intelligently monitors memory usage to prevent system crashes.

* **üìÇ Intelligent File Management**
    * **Configurable Filtering:** Skip files based on duration, filesize, or bitrate.
    * **Size Reduction Validation:** Only replaces the source file if the encode is meaningfully smaller.
    * **Flexible I/O:** Configurable input/output directories and file naming schemes.

## üñ•Ô∏è Console Interface

The script provides a clean and powerful live console UI powered by the `rich` library to monitor the entire encoding process at a glance.

**The interface provides at-a-glance information on:**

* **Overall Batch Progress:** A summary panel shows files completed, total space saved, elapsed time, and a dynamically updated ETA.
* **Parallel Worker Status:** See the status and logs for each video being processed in its own dedicated panel.
* **Real-Time Progress Bars:** Detailed progress bars for time-consuming operations like VMAF analysis and the final encode.
* **System Monitoring:** Live RAM usage to ensure system stability during intensive encodes.

## üöÄ Getting Started

This guide will walk you through setting up the script and its dependencies.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed and accessible:

* ‚úÖ **Python 3.8+**: Make sure it's added to your system's PATH during installation. ([Download](https://python.org/downloads/))
* ‚úÖ **FFmpeg**: The `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` command-line tools. Full builds for Windows are available from [Gyan.dev](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/). It's recommended to unzip them to a simple, persistent location like `C:\ffmpeg`.

  <summary><strong>What is VMAF?</strong> (Click to expand)</summary>
  
  Video Multimethod Assessment Fusion (VMAF) is a perceptual video quality metric developed by Netflix. It uses a machine-learning model to predict subjective video quality more accurately than traditional metrics like PSNR or SSIM. It has become an industry standard for optimizing video encoding to ensure the best viewing experience for a given bandwidth. This script leverages VMAF to make intelligent, quality-based encoding decisions.

### Installation & Configuration

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    This is the main step. It will download the script, configuration settings (config.ini), and the **required VMAF model file** all at once.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Snickrr/Auto-VMAF-Encoder.git
    cd Auto-VMAF-Encoder
    ```

2.  **Install Python Libraries**
    Open a Command Prompt or Terminal in the project folder and run the following command:
    ```bash
    pip install rich psutil "scenedectect[opencv]"
    ```

3.  **Configure `config.ini`**
    Full configuration settings can be found as a PDF: Auto Vmaf Encoder Manual & Technical Documentation
